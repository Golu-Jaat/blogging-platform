# Backend Folder

The backend for this project is implemented at the repository root using `server.js`, `routes/`, `models/`, and `middleware/`.

This folder exists for organizational clarity. To start the backend, run from the project root:

```
npm run dev
```

Or, if you prefer starting from here, this proxy entry points to the root server:

```
node Backend/server.js
```
